// input:  none
// output: none

// add a foregound thread to the scheduler
// Inputs: pointer to a void/void foreground task
//         number of bytes allocated for its stack
//         priority, 0 is highest, 5 is the lowest
// Outputs: 1 if successful, 0 if this thread can not be added
// stack size must be divisable by 8 (aligned to double word boundary)
// In Lab 2, you can ignore both the stackSize and priority fields
// In Lab 3, you can ignore the stackSize fields

// returns the thread ID for the currently running thread
// Inputs: none
// Outputs: Thread ID, number greater than zero

//******** OS_AddPeriodicThread *************** 
// add a background periodic task
// typically this function receives the highest priority
// Inputs: pointer to a void/void background function
//         period given in system time units (12.5ns)
//         priority 0 is the highest, 5 is the lowest
// Outputs: 1 if successful, 0 if this thread can not be added
// You are free to select the time resolution for this function
// It is assumed that the user task will run to completion and return
// This task can not spin, block, loop, sleep, or kill
// This task can call OS_Signal  OS_bSignal	 OS_AddThread
// This task does not have a Thread ID
// In lab 2, this command will be called 0 or 1 times
// In lab 2, the priority field can be ignored

// place this thread into a dormant state
// input:  number of msec to sleep
// output: none
// You are free to select the time resolution for this function
// OS_Sleep(0) implements cooperative multitasking

// ******** OS_Kill ************
// kill the currently running thread, release its TCB and stack
// input:  none
// output: none

// suspend execution of currently running thread
// scheduler will choose another thread to execute
// Can be used to implement cooperative multitasking 
// Same function as OS_Sleep(0)
// input:  none
// output: none

// ******** OS_Time ************
// return the system time 
// Inputs:  none
// Outputs: time in 12.5ns units, 0 to 4294967295

// It is ok to change the resolution and precision of this function as long as 
//   this function and OS_TimeDifference have the same resolution and precision

// ******** OS_TimeDifference ************
// Calculates difference between two times
// Inputs:  two times measured with OS_Time
// Outputs: time difference in 12.5ns units

// It is ok to change the resolution and precision of this function as long as 
//   this function and OS_Time have the same resolution and precision

// sets the system time to zero (from Lab 1)
// Inputs:  none
// Outputs: none
// You are free to change how this works

// ******** OS_MsTime ************
// reads the current time in msec (from Lab 1)
// Inputs:  none
// Outputs: time in ms units
// You are free to select the time resolution for this function
// It is ok to make the resolution to match the first call to OS_AddPeriodicThread

//******** OS_Launch *************** 
// start the scheduler, enable interrupts
// Inputs: number of 12.5ns clock cycles for each time slice
//         you may select the units of this parameter
// Outputs: none (does not return)
// In Lab 2, you can ignore the theTimeSlice field
// In Lab 3, you should implement the user-defined TimeSlice field
// It is ok to limit the range of theTimeSlice to match the 24-bit SysTick
